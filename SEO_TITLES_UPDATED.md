## SEO Improvements

### âœ… Best Practices Applied:

1. **Unique Titles** - Each page has a distinct title (no duplicates)
2. **Keyword Optimization** - Primary keywords placed near the beginning
3. **Brand Consistency** - "YellowFolder" brand name included in every title
4. **Length Optimization** - All titles under 75 characters (prevents truncation in search results)
5. **Descriptive & Clear** - Titles clearly describe page content
6. **Action-Oriented** - Use compelling language to encourage clicks
7. **Target Audience** - Mentions "K-12 Schools", "Students", "Schools" where relevant

### ðŸŽ¯ Keywords Targeted:

- **Primary:** YellowFolder, records management, student records, school records
- **Secondary:** K-12, cloud-based, digital storage, retrieval, training, demo, pricing
- **Long-tail:** education records management, school records management, affordable records management

### Method Used:
Added `<Head>` component from `next/head` to each page with custom `<title>` tag.

const HomePage = () => (
	<>
		<Head>

		</Head>
		<Home />
	</>
);

export default HomePage;
```

## Testing Performed

### âœ… Dev Server Testing:
- All pages compile successfully
- No errors in terminal
- Titles render correctly in browser

### âœ… Visual Verification:
You can verify titles by:
1. Opening http://localhost:3000
2. Navigating to each page
3. Checking browser tab title
4. Viewing page source (Ctrl+U or Cmd+Option+U)
5. Looking for `<title>` tag in `<head>`

### Example Page Source:
```html
<head>
  <title>YellowFolder - Cloud-Based Student Records Management for K-12 Schools</title>
  <!-- other meta tags -->
</head>
```

## Verification Checklist

Before deploying to production, verify:

- [ ] All page titles display correctly in browser tabs
- [ ] No titles are truncated (all under 75 characters)
- [ ] Brand name "YellowFolder" appears in all titles
- [ ] Keywords are relevant to each page's content
- [ ] No duplicate titles across pages
- [ ] Titles are grammatically correct
- [ ] Titles make sense in search results context

## Next Steps: Meta Descriptions (Recommended)

While titles are now optimized, I recommend also adding **meta descriptions** for even better SEO:

### What are Meta Descriptions?
- 155-160 character summaries that appear under titles in search results
- Don't directly affect rankings, but significantly impact click-through rates
- Should include primary keywords and a call-to-action

### Example Meta Description:
```javascript
<Head>
  <title>YellowFolder - Cloud-Based Student Records Management for K-12 Schools</title>
  <meta name="description" content="YellowFolder provides secure, cloud-based student records management for K-12 schools. Store, retrieve, and manage education records efficiently. Get started today!" />
</Head>
```

**Would you like me to add meta descriptions as well?**
